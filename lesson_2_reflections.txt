What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created and it stores all metadata.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The stagin area is where there are the files that will be commited. The repository has files that could be commited (previous adding to the staging area or not - foo files -) and the repository has the commited files - at least one commit - .
